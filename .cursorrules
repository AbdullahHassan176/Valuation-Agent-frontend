# Cursor Rules â€” FRONTEND (Valuation Agent Workspace)

GOAL
- Scaffold a Next.js 14 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui app that consumes BACKEND at http://localhost:8000.
- Do NOT implement business logic or pricing. Focus on wiring and basic pages later.

HOW TO RUN (later)
- pnpm install
- pnpm dev (expects NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE to be set)

DOCKER
- `docker compose up --build` from parent uses this repo's Dockerfile.
- Current image is a placeholder. Replace with actual Next.js Dockerfile when UI exists.

INTEGRATION
- Only call BACKEND endpoints (never API directly) from the browser.
- Use the shared SDK in the future (not generated yet).

GUARDRAILS
- Do not create valuation logic or IFRS content here.
- Keep env vars prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ for browser exposure.
